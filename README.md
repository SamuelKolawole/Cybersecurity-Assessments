# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Assessments Portfolio

This repository contains all the hands-on cybersecurity projects and reports I completed as part of the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate**. It showcases a wide range of technical competencies through simulated security tasks, real-world scenarios, and structured documentation.

Each folder reflects critical security functions and demonstrates readiness for an entry-level role in a Security Operations Center (SOC), GRC team, or analyst position.

## 🎓 About the Program

The **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate** is a rigorous 8-course program that prepares learners for entry-level roles in cybersecurity. It covers:

- Incident detection and response  
- Network and system security  
- SIEM and log analysis  
- Security audits and risk assessments  
- Threat modeling  
- Scripting and automation with Python  
- Key frameworks: **NIST CSF**, **MITRE ATT&CK**, **Pyramid of Pain**, and **CIS Controls**

This portfolio demonstrates the practical application of these skills using tools, frameworks, and techniques aligned with industry standards.
