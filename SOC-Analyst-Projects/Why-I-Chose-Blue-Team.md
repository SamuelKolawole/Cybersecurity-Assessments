# Why I Chose the Blue Team 🛡️

From the moment I began my cybersecurity journey, I found myself drawn to the **defensive** side of the field. While the Red Team seemed thrilling, it never truly aligned with how I think and feel.

I’m naturally cautious, observant, and like to think like a **detective**. I enjoy investigating patterns, detecting threats, and figuring out how systems can be better protected. I even find myself scanning for tiny details others miss, and being called “extra” by people for always double checking things, but that’s just how I’m wired. 😂

The Blue Team reflects who I am: someone who likes to **protect**, not attack. I’m focused on becoming a **SOC Analyst** and growing into a strong **cyber defender** who knows how to respond to incidents, monitor systems, and help reduce risk for organizations.

This isn’t just a career choice for me, it’s who I am.
